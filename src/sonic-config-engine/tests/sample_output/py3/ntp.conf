# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers.  Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up.  Please consider joining the
# pool: <http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>

#listen on source interface if configured, else 
#only listen on MGMT_INTERFACE, LOOPBACK_INTERFACE ip when MGMT_INTERFACE is not defined, or eth0 
# if we don't have both of them (default is to listen on all ip addresses)
interface ignore wildcard

# set global variable for configured source interface name
# set global boolean to indicate if the ip of the configured source interface is configured
# if the source interface is configured but no ip on that interface, then listen on another
# interface based on existing logic

# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
